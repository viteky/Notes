# What note taking methods do I want to implement?
* Zettelkasten for taking notes during lectures and reading materials
* PARA method for doing assignments and projects

# How do these methods link?

I will take my regular notes using the zettelkasten method.
For projects and areas I will link to my zettelkasten notes if necessary.

Projects are for short term assignments (e.g coding assignments, ctf machines)

Areas are for longer term goals (e.g course units)

I will use a map of contents for handling linking between zettelkasten notes. Permanent notes can also have links to other notes.

Resources will be for course materials etc.
