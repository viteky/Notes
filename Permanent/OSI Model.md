# OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model describes the layers of a theoretical network. It helps us understand the path data travels and how it is presented. This gives us a better insight into how different systems communicate. 

## 7. Application

## 6. Presentation 

## 5. Session

## 4. Transport

## 3. Network

The network layer, as the name suggests, is responsible for communication between networks. This layer handles logical addressing and routing. 

Some examples of the network layer include IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), and VPN (Virtual Private Network) protocols such as IPSec and SSL/TLS VPN.

## 2. Data Link

The data link layer is responsible for connecting nodes on the same network. This can be Ethernet (802.3), WiFi (802.11). 

Each device has an assigned MAC address. A MAC address is a hexadecimal address with a colon separating each byte. The three left bytes identify the vendor and the remaining three identify the unique address of the network interface.

## 1. Physical

The physical layer is responsible for connecting a machine to a network using a cable or some wireless signal.

E.g ethernet cable, 2.4g/5g wireless
